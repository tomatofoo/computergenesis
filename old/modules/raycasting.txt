0-- RAYCASTER ENGINE RENDERING SPECIFICATION --

---- DEFINITIONS ----

DDA Raycasting: A style of raycasting described at https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html that only checks on tile borders, 
meaning it is very fast and completely accurate.

---- SPECIFICATION ----

For every column on the screen, cast a ray outwards using DDA Raycasting until the ray's length is greater than the render 
distance. During this cast, look for tiles in both tilemaps (the tilemap data specification can be found at data/spec.txt). 
If a wall is encountered, calculate its y-coordinate on the display surface and add the line surface to the depth buffer.

The entities are rendered column by column just as tiles are. For each tile the raycsater reaches, it checks for sprites in 
that tile and renders a single vertical stripe.
