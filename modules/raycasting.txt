0-- RAYCASTER ENGINE RENDERING SPECIFICATION --

---- DEFINITIONS ----

Depth Buffer: a buffer of all the sprite surfaces before they are rendered that is ordered based on the depth of the sprite; 
this will contain every single image, its depth, and its position on the screen to render it.

DDA Raycasting: A style of raycasting described at https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html that only checks on tile borders, 
meaning it is very fast and completely accurate.

---- SPECIFICATION ----

For every column on the screen, cast a ray outwards using DDA Raycasting until the ray's length is greater than the render 
distance. During this cast, look for tiles in both tilemaps (the tilemap data specification can be found at data/spec.txt). 
If a wall is encountered, calculate its y-coordinate on the display surface and add the line surface to the depth buffer.

Next, the sprites are rendered. This is done by iterating through all the sprites. For each sprite, check if it is in front of 
the camera, and if it is, adding it to the depth buffer to be rendered. To check if it is in front of the camera, get the 
sprite's position relative to the camera using Pygame's Vector3D class. Use the relative position to determine if it is in 
front. To get its position on screen, use the ratio of x:z and y:z of the sprite. To get the size to resize the surface, use 
the z value (relative to the camera).

After all the rays are casted, all the surfaces in the depth buffer will be rendered using the Depth Buffer's render().


The main thread will be the event thread. The rendering thread will do all the rendering calculations, and will call the blit 
function in the main thread using Queue.
